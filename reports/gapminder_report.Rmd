This report was prepared to the attention of the United Nations. It analyzes the relationship between a country's GDP, its life expectancy and CO2 emissions. Our goal is to determine to what degree a countryâ€™s economic strength or weakness may be related to its public health status and impact on climate pollution. We hypothesize that both life expectancy and CO2 emissions increase with a country's GDP.

```{r read data, include=FALSE}
# 1) make an object called gapminder_1997
gapminder_1997 <- read_csv("data/gapminder_1997.csv")
```

```{r gdp_lifeExp-1997-plot, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}


# 2) make the plot. The aes function indicates the data being used, labs tells it what to label
ggplot(gapminder_1997)+
  aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, color = continent)+
  labs(x = "GDP", y = "Life Expectancy")+
  geom_point()+
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1")

```


```{r basic-country-stats}
#number of countries
nCountries <-
  gapminder_1997 %>%
  select(country) %>%
  n_distinct()

# minimum GDP
minGDP <- gapminder_1997 %>%
  summarize(round(min(gdpPercap)))%>%
  pull()

maxGDP <- gapminder_1997 %>%
  summarize(round(max(gdpPercap)))%>%
  pull()

```

The number of countries in the dataset is `r nCountries`.
The minimum GDP is `r minGDP` and the maximum GDP is `r maxGDP`
```{r table}
gapminder_1997 %>%
  filter(continent == "Oceania") %>%
  kable()
```
